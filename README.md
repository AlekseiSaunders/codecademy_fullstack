General info

Script created as part of the Full Stack Developer course at Codecademy.

Inspired by a repository forked from nickpatsiopoulos/MMessages. I liked their idea to separat the data from the script, but stuck with using json as that seemed a little more mainstream than yaml.

"Rather than store the songs in the javascript file itself, I decided to add them to a separate yaml file from which the javascript file reads. This serves to separate the content layer from the code" - nickpatsiopoulos

Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript / ECMAScript 2020
- JSON

Setup

I kept this as a webapp as opposed to writing it for Node.js like the original.

Status

Still needed is code to clear previous writes of randomized data in their associated divs

Future Possibilities
